You can save a command as a favorite and
turn it into a key shortcut and/or a
button.  The favorites editor is
automatically populated with your
previously saved favorites, frequently
run commands, and recent history.

There are two flavors of favorites.
Immediate favorites run when they are
activated.  Non-immediate ones act
like templates and the first {} is
replaced with what you had selected
before activating the favorite.

The previous command is saved in history.
