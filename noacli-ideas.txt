async shell
noacli -- no ampersand
sash steves asynchronous shell

o  started, partial implementation
*  done
!/ next
E  buggy
-  gui implelemented, no code
x  not supported in Qt


Things to implement soon:
? close stdin
  job: double click connect to send command to editor
o job life cycle
*   connect to qtail window status
*   delete job if command is done and window is closed
    timeout if no window?
* tables: implement vertical headers??
*   make corner button clickable to reset sort column to -1
* qtail: resize after visible? or after first read

  command parser
    prefix or suffix for output dest
      stdout:stderr
      > @qtail  2>@qtail
      default qtail:log
    handle |  --> tree
    handle <
    handle >
    set window title based on regex filter list
  update status bar with recent process status and errors
  short output in status window
  single lines to status bar (and status window?)

  job manager and hsitory:
    scroll to new entry
    resize columns

Bugs:
  gets middle of file on /usr/dict/words without --whole
? what to do with stderr? always log?
E scrollTo not working
