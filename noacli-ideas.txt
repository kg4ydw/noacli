noacli -- no ampersand asynchronous shell

o  started, partial implementation
*  done
!/ next
E  buggy
-  gui implelemented, no code
x  not supported in Qt
D  documented feature (in Readme.md)
d  documented internally (doc settings doc)
t  documented internally with tool tip

User interface questions:
o  Should all the tables be respaced with resizeRowsToContents()
   Is column selection between tableviewer and column picker awkward
   is the documentation unclear or too wordy
   is a wrapper editor and save needed
   is a keybindings viewer / editor needed
*  is it OK to automatically resize the window to max screen size
   are the options named well
*  should the window auto-resize theshold be a setting
   is it annoing that history scrolls to bottom and resets sort order
     when a command is run
     when history items are copied from the docs

Things to implement soon:
 * small output title counter
 ! table should send stderr to log
 * doubleclick on favorites editor headers to resize row
 ? built in commands should get marked done in history
 E log window flush process (context) doesn't work
   qtail: set extra selections for previously found items (clear when?)
 * table parsing in qtail
      fixed width white space tables
 o add title to jobinfo and use it when small output dup
   close stdin
 o job life cycle
 *   delete job if command is done and window is closed
 *   timeout if no window?
   small buttons in dock widget headers
     jobs: clean
     history: reset sort
 *   alternately: document table corner button that does this
   resource manager (may undo this)
     noacli-res.qrc
 !   icons broken again
D* if text is selected before pushing template button, save it and paste over mark
 ! qtail: bind ctrl-f to focus on search box
   qtail: translate terminal colors
   qtail: resize on zoom?
 * tag name of button template for window title
     hidden text?
     leave out of history & job view (or copy to title)
   regex on commands
     aliases
     ssh -> setsid
     ssh, man -> set title
   regex on output
     sbatch -> tail
   timestamps
     by option
     qtail?
     job manager
   shortcuts for internal actions
   detach processes before exiting (optionally)
 * SETTING: delay after first data before initial window resize
   SETTING: max qtail window size (in px), to allow free expansion
   add another kill button:  stop(2) terminate kill
   context->add new env  should move cursor (and scroll to) supplied item (even if it already exists)
   history context menu: set vert spacing: expand vs minimum
   qtail on files directly
   history view row height
     autosize rows if they would be smaller
     reset to default on corner button?
   menu item
     close all windows
     kill all subprocesses
     disown all subprocesses (default on exit?)

User visible bugs:
   duplicate key bindings don't get background paint until dialog is reopened
   mac bugs
     history arrows don't work on mac
     icons and app name don't work on mac (wrong geom?)
 * favorites editor bugs
DE    should warn on duplicate names? (color?)
 *    fix editing command causing duplicate entries
x! block tostop signal : try os.setsid ?
     detect child proc trying to read stdin/stderr
     kill child proc?
     move to terminal window automatically?
     preconnect pty for this purpose?
   gets middle of file on /usr/dict/words without --whole
   qtail gives useless errors on file not found
   default geometry profile used but not checked at start (use setChecked)
   flowlayout overlapping buttons (rare? one time glitch?)
 ! settings apply button is delayed until ok pressed
 o resize history to fit window at start (scroll bar bug, only when tiny)
     make sure tableview is resized to fit
       at start
       when dock is popped out or resized
 *   corner button resets width
  ? job manager column viwe width issues
      fix with corner reset button
      use header double click to resize
   bind hitory context menu to history headers too

Bugs:
   fixed width viewer handles slow sockets badly
   job manager context menu missing terminate
   log flush context: doesn't do anything?
   qtail is slow reading large files
     read in smaller chunks
     use cursor.beginEditBlock / endEditBlock
   reload button should change for pipes
 ? what to do with stderr? always log?
   lots of stuff packed into class noacli that could go elsewhere
 ? make file dialog not modal
   dock: resize? on topLevelChanged (float/nofloat)
   when a dock is pulled out, check if it has scrollbars and resize
   Poor data flow between jobItem and smallOutput (refactor)
   'set max' too often -- use histiresis of mul+1 ?
   file dialog cwd filter breaks in python 3.8 (work around in place)

completed misc. features
 *  button should set title from button name
 * command edit should grab focus after accepting input
 * job: double click connect to send command to editor
 *   connect to qtail window status
 * tables: implement vertical headers??
 *   make corner button clickable to reset sort column to -1
 * qtail: resize after visible? or after first read
 * change Qsettings to use sections
 *   only read general settings for settings dialog
 *   move favorites to its own section
D*   save window position profiles in a section
D* look at cursor and set file dialog filter
 * delete QSettings that match defaults
 * at start, send version to smalloutput
?* job pull down menu should also raise window
 x Job and history view: WordWrapMode = WrapWordsOrAnywhere (not supported)
D* file dialog: disable path prefix stripping without changing start dir
 * built in command output should go to small window (too)
 * log window pause / resume process (context)
 * print exit value if keep is false
 x small output: replace horiz rule image; scale image to fit box
 * add running indicator to small output (kill and log buttons)

fixed bugs
 * retore geometry doesn't grab the current selected geometry
 * history save bug with newline prefix
d* log window needs a threshold LogBatchLines = 5?
 * tooltips on buttons --> command
D* change pick file behavior (without conditions here)
 *   if prefix starts with / and contains no * treat as intial cwd and strip
D*   if it ends in / select dirs only??
 n   maybe output dir/{} syntax (this is just too clever for its own good)
 * add tooltips to favarites editor command
 * scroll job manager to bottom on new job?
 * qtail main window doesn't autoresize even when it has horiz scrollbar
 * small output size not set at start if not visible
   make template buttons distinctive
     immediate buttons are bold
