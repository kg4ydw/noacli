By default, command output is sent
to the small output dock.  When the
output from a command exceeds the size
of that, it is transferred to a new
qtail window.

What you run doesn't have to be a
single command, it can be a small shell
script snip.  This script outputs lines
slowly, so you can see the action of
the small output window.
