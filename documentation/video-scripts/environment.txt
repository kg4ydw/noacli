Environment variables are inherited from
your environment by default, but you can
override inherited values and add new
values from the context menu of the
environment editor.

The replaced or new value can last just
for the current session, or be saved for
future sessions.  You can also mark a
value to be deleted for commands you run
or masked to be removed for future
sessions as well.

You can restore the original inherited
value by changing the mode back to inherited.
