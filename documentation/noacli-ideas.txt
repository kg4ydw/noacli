noacli -- no ampersand asynchronous shell


This is part todo list and part brainstorming repository.

Column key:
o  partial implementation1
*  done
!  next
E  buggy
x  not supported in Qt (or I haven't figured it out) (might still be possible)
n  decided to not implement this
D  documented feature (in Readme.md)
d  documented internally (doc settings doc)
V  documented in a video
v  documented in a future video
t  documented internally with tool tip

 -Things to implement soon:
   editing button name should update (or insert) comment in command
 - BUG: job manager: add force remove job (how does this happen?)
 - tableviewer: cli option to set show/hide columns initially
 . search all incremental update
 . search all rerun button
 . hyperlink regex on command regex match
     assoc array of command regex
     array of body regex + hyperlink action
     hyperlink action: command with regex subst
 ? autoresize findall window height if a second window is opened underneath?
 ? add completion/status/window open  icons to jobs menu pulldown
   tableviewer: numberize selected/all cells that match ^\s*[+-]?\d+\s*$ (for sorting, formatting)
     same for floats?
 * qtable -> view menu: add sort/select checkbox from column picker
 * add setting and timer to sync settings and history (bug fix)
   QTextBrowser.searchPaths() to help find internal docs
 ? Bug: reload doesn't work on --file
   Bug: --format=md doesn't work on pipes?
   qtail: autodetect format
      start with <?xml --> html (or xml? check DOCTYPE line?)
      start with \e[ -> ansi
   preliminary ansi support
      set ansi flag or input hook
      translate known ansi codes
      log untranslated ansi codes and request bug filing
      regex "\033[(\d*)m"
      30-36: span style="color: \e -> \033
       0: reset to default format
       1: style="font-weight: bold;
       31: red
       32: green 
       36: teal (cyan?)
   add ansi format option to qtail (via aha type translation)
   autodetect formats? html ansi
   disable word wrap on line threshold?
   on -w disable: word wrap, adjust size (prevent wordwrap hangs)
   qtail search dock: update search results if file grows (manual update?)
   qtail search dock: save regex groups as extra columns?
   general settings editor needs a search
   history could resize vertically on popout?
   window title: do a better job of eliding long commands
   table column picker needs an undo select columns
   cd should parse ~
   realign general settings editor to be callable from other apps
   tableview: use (context,picked) column for vertical headers
   tableview: replace column headers with selected row
   fix command parser to use built environment setting (XXXX marked)
 o tableview sort
      convert numbers before sorting?

 -Maybe implement these
 ! qtail: enable dock nesting and other properties?
   button dock: handle favorite rename?

 -high priority bugs
 * watched|autorefresh file dialog shouldn't close if it is empty
 ! jobs sometimes won't go away after exiting
 ! --filter= doesn't support regex
   mac bugs
     history arrows don't work on mac
     icons and app name don't work on mac
 ? fileDialog doesn't always trim prefix correctly
     doesn't work consistently if no prefix directory (./ doesn't work either)
 o   leaves junk before filename if prefix doesn't match
 x   partial directory names can't be matched
   document environment editor a bit
      mode?
 *    "add" button in dialog
 ! QPersistentModelIndex contamination, trace and check types (marked)
     also in noajobs.py
   tableview doesn't merge headings when whole columns are merged
   tableview: allow editing column headers?

 -Misc things to implement
 ! qtail: translate terminal colors (for git diff)
   sync should load missing geom settings
   shortcuts for internal actions
 o history context menu: set vert spacing: expand vs minimum
     context menu -> reset to default height
 o history view row height
 !   use minimum row height (context/default)
     use default row height? (current default)
     autosize rows (only?) if they would be smaller
     reset to default on corner button?
   menu item (implemented, but not in menu)
 *   close all windows
 *   kill all subprocesses
 o   disown all subprocesses (default on exit?)
 * if output windows are not visible, add extra status to main window?

 -User visible bugs:
   some dialogs may not be reentrant -- make them singletons?
   qtable: sometimes splits lines (buffer doesn't join?)
   command buttons can be broken by setwrap (more testing needed)
   duplicate key bindings don't get background paint until dialog is reopened
 * empty dock container bug
 *   qt bug -- work around applied and commented
     disable workaround for newer versions?  make workaround a setting??
 * favorites editor bugs
DE    should warn on duplicate names? (color?)

 -Bugs:
 ! refactor flowlayout to separate Qt code and noacli code (inherit)
 o file dialog is modal and can get lost
 *   set always on top? (partial fix)
 !   make this a setting / change default on version?
   version 0.9.9.8s gives exception importing wrappers from previous version
      convince QSettings to use enum.name for enum OutWin
   simpleargs processing in noajobs.py
 !   called in multiple places (refactor?)
     return value not checked for errors
 !   errors not displayed
   refactor tableviewer simpleargs to merge with parseargs
   settings dialogs use shared variables and should not be duplicate opened
      raise and focus old dialog instead
   button dock editor dialog is not sized properly or resized on demand
   tableviewer sort doesn't recognize numbers as numbers
   inconsistent coding style as I was learning Qt as I wrote this and discovered some Qt features after having reimplemented them
 ! new env marked as 'inherit' but not in parent should be deleted on save
   (marked) OutWin commands with no external command do nothing (usage msg?)
 ! Trigger full usage msg for table/tail somehow
   test Qt dock bug on Ubuntu 20
   test sibling markers
 o QFont styled item delegate
     displayed font name is ugly
     fonts are handed as objects to QSettings, save as font name later?
 * 'type' builtin fails on old python (fix untested)
 ? what to do with stderr? always log?
 x    maybe write a QProcess wrapperclass that makes stderr look like a QIODevice
      send tableviewer stderr to log and/or smalloutput?
   lots of stuff packed into class noacli that could go elsewhere
 ? make file dialog not modal
     file dialog could temp insert icon in buffer where it will drop names
     insert icon=self.style().standardIcon(QStyle.SP_FileDialogStart)
   Poor data flow between jobItem and smallOutput (refactor)

 - Main features not fully implemented

D* button editor ("favorites")
     right click context menu
 ?      edit in larger window (or just stretch the cell)
        ui.tableView.resizerowsToContents
     add Settings save menu item somewhere

 n status icon? from logged job?
   text window (terminal?) with regex progress icon / meter

 o bookmarks and highlights (fancy find all)
     set context size (words? chars?)
 *   collect docks: tabify all and move to left
     SETTING: set dock collection location or style or default (tabify, vert stack, etc.)
 !   Action to rerun all searches
 *   Adjust search to update window progressively instead of freezing until done?
 x     allow aborting long running search
