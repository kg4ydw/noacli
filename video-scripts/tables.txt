The table viewer looks at a file or
output from a command and tries to find
a table in it.  It automatically
recognizes csv files delimited by
commas, pipes, colons, or tabs.

It tries to recognize fixed format text
but sometimes doesn't get that right.

You can give it hints or skip initial
text if this is a problem.

Once you have a table, you can use the
column picker to supress uninteresting
columns.  You can switch between
selecting columns in the view or sorting
by a column.

You can filter the entire table or
you can pick one column and hit return
to filter by just one column.

You can rearrange columns, but this is
not saved.

You can select a cell to copy it and
paste its contents somewhere else.
